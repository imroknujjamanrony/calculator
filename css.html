A traffic jam means a long line of vehicles stuck in jam. It is a regular scene in big cities and towns. Now it has become a serious problem. It creates a deplorable condition in our regular life.

      There are many causes of traffic jams. Increasing the number of buses, trucks, autorickshaws, and rickshaws are the main causes of traffic jams. Overpopulation is also a cause. On the other hand, the traffic control system in our country is not developed.
